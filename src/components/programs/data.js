        details: 'Primary school education in Dzikwa covers children aged 6 to 13, encompassing grades 1 to 7. The curriculum includes subjects such as English, the native language (typically Shona), Mathematics, Science & Technology, ICT, Family & Religious Studies, Heritage Studies, Agriculture, Visual & Performing Arts, and Physical Education. Dzikwa Trust facilitates the education of its children by enrolling them in eight government or municipal primary schools located in Dzivarasekwa township. Regular communication is maintained between Dzikwa Trust staff, guardians, school heads, and teachers to ensure the students’ progress and well-being. Upon completing primary school, Dzikwa Trust pupils undergo the Grade 7 exam, administered by the Zimbabwe School Examinations Council (ZIMSEC). The attached graph illustrates the comparison between the pass rates of Dzikwa Trust and the national average for this exam. Notably, our students have achieved a 100% pass rate over the past three years. This exceptional performance can be attributed to a range of factors, including the provision of additional remedial lessons conducted daily at Dzikwa Centre by former students, volunteers, and professional teachers. Furthermore, the implementation of e-learning platforms such as Akello Smart Learning and Learning Passport has played a significant role in enhancing our students’ educational achievements. Dzikwa Trust actively invests in licenses for these e-learning platforms to facilitate effective learning experiences.'

        details: 'Children who achieve satisfactory results in their primary school exams proceed to O-level studies, starting from Form 1 and continuing until Form 4. The number of subjects studied increases to a range of 8 to 11. Dzivarasekwa is home to two government high schools, namely DZ 1 High School and DZ 2 High School, with approximately 50 Dzikwa Trust students attending each of these schools. Upon successfully passing their O-level exams with commendable grades in at least 5 subjects, students have the option to pursue A-level studies (Forms 5-6) or other vocational courses. However, the continuation of Dzikwa Trust students’ studies beyond O-levels requires the specific consent of their individual sponsors. At both the O-level and A-level stages, Dzikwa Trust students consistently achieve final examination results that surpass the national and local averages. Over the span of eight years, it is evident that the Dzikwa Trust consistently outperforms the national pass rate, as depicted by the bar graph. The graph clearly illustrates that a higher percentage of students pass the Dzikwa Trust exam compared to the national exam, indicating that the Dzikwa Trust’s evaluation of student performance and knowledge is more effective. This remarkable performance can be attributed to various factors, including the provision of additional remedial lessons conducted daily at the Dzikwa Centre by former students, volunteers, and professional teachers. Additionally, the implementation of e-learning platforms such as Akello Smart Learning and Learning Passport has played a significant role in enhancing the educational achievements of our students.

        details: 'The COVID-19 pandemic unraveled the workings of the world as we knew it, and the significance of sound e-learning systems on education became evident. At the same time, the need to rely on e-learning systems laid bare all the deficiencies in developing countries. Schools in Zimbabwe were closed for long periods. The underdeveloped infrastructure and lack of tools made it impossible for schools in poor townships to provide education via e-learning to the most vulnerable youth. Dzikwa Trust Fund tackled this barrier to education in Dzivaresekwa head-on in 2020. We started quickly building up our own capacity to provide e-learning. We realized that e-learning platforms, with proper facilitation, could be a potent instrument in closing the learning gap for students under Dzikwa Trust education support program. We were able to secure smartphones and tablets, thanks to Bank of Finland, Huawei Zimbabwe and UNICEF Zimbabwe donations. Dzikwa Trust Centre can provide a safe environment to make use of digital learning solutions. The Center’s internet connectivity was even enhanced for e-learning. We nominated one dedicated Officer to oversee all e-learning efforts and we secured access to devices to start in July 2020.  After research, we chose affordable e-learning platforms with suitable content and data for the curriculum and examinations in Zimbabwe.'

        details: 'Dzikwa Trust is providing daily hot meals for its children from Monday to Saturday. The kitchen/dining hall building was funded by a Finnish development cooperation grant in 2010. The meal consists of sadza (thick maize meal porridge) and vegetables, supplemented with meat, fish, or beans. For many of the children, this may be their only decent meal of the day. Five mothers from the community with children in the Dzikwa Trust programme work as cooks. Most of the vegetables, as well as chicken and rabbit meat, are provided by the Dzikwa Trust Food Security programme. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Dzikwa Trust started serving a takeaway meal and extended the service to a large number of needy community children. In 2020-2021, Dzikwa Kitchen offered on average 850 hot meals/ day under its emergency feeding scheme. The record year was 2021, with a total of 230,000 meals served. In normal circumstances, the daily numbers average around 350 and the monthly numbers between 8,000 – 9,000 meals. Dzikwa Kitchen is open from Monday to Saturday. Meals are being served between 10 am to 2.30 pm and children come to eat either before going to school or after school. Dzikwa Kitchen records everyone coming to eat school by school. Supplies are procured in bulk monthly, with vegetables and most of the meat coming from Dzikwa Trust’s own food production. The average cost/ meal is USD 0.62. Dzikwa Kitchen also continuously feeds 80 – 100 needy children who are not in the education support programme, from nearby poor families. This is our way of supporting the community at large within our means. A total of 1,7 million hot meals offered since 2003 Dzikwa Kitchen also feeds over 60 needy children who are not in the education support programme, from nearby poor families. This is our way of supporting the community at large within our means. Combating Food Insecurity In 2009, Dzikwa Trust provided over 134,000 hot meals during a national crisis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, meal distribution peaked at 229,175 in 2021. With 2024 declared a national disaster, Dzikwa Trust is expected to further scale up meal provision. You can help by donating in-kind or financial contributions to support those facing food insecurity.'

Dzikwa Trust Re-forestation & Food Security Project occupies a 60-hectare degraded land area in Dzivarasekwa, leased in 2012 from the City of Harare. Soon after initial tree planting, we expanded with a proper plant nursery, with both firewood and indigenous tree seedlings, horticulture, fruit trees, and beekeeping. From 2011 to 2016, the funding came from the Finnish development cooperation grants. Our collaborators have been the City of Harare, Forestry Commission of Zimbabwe, AGRITEX/Ministry of Agriculture, Bindura University of Science Education, and VITRI/Viikki Tropical Resources Institute of the University of Helsinki. We have planted 70,000 trees over 20 hectares over the years. The food security activities have expanded and cover two greenhouses, a large open-air irrigated vegetable garden, as well as broiler and rabbit husbandry, thanks to grants from Netherlands and Australia in 2018-2020. We now provide 80% of the daily kitchen vegetables, 50 chickens, and 20 rabbits for meat on a weekly basis. Since 2007, Dzikwa Trust has planted over 70,000 trees in the outskirts of Dzivarasekwa to reforest a degraded land area. Dzikwa Trust produces on average 20,000 tree seedlings annually in its nursery. Dzikwa Trust organises an annual Tree Planting Day for its children in early December. Children develop understanding, awareness, and sensitivity to environmental challenges in Dzivarasekwa and in Zimbabwe. The aim is to enhance children’s motivation to do something in their own environment to identify and help resolve every-day environmental issues. Children learn about climate change and the importance of trees. The Food Security produces annually 4,000 broilers, 1,200 rabbits, and most of the large variety of vegetables for the feeding of children at the Dzikwa Kitchen. Dzikwa Trust is establishing a fishpond, and new vegetable and herbal gardens. Currently one productive orchard gives fruits to children, and two new orchards are being built. Beekeeping ensures thriving honey production. The Reforestation and Food Security programme has had over 30 students on study-related attachments.'
